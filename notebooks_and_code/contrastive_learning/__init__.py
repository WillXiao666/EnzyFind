ConPLex-style Contrastive Learning for Enzyme-Metabolite Interaction Prediction

This module implements a contrastive learning approach inspired by ConPLex for predicting
enzyme-metabolite interactions. It maps both metabolites and enzymes to a shared latent
space and uses contrastive learning with triplet loss to improve interaction prediction.
